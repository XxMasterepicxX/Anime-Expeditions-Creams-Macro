Pre Start (camera setup, Team Loadout, a per-map default walk, the task's
Macro Operation template's Pre Start blocks), pressing Start Game, and then
watching the battle for Battle-phase blocks (Upgrade/Sell/Auto Upgrade Unit)
and a Victory/Defeat screen -- which is recorded to run history/win-loss
counts and, if a webhook is configured, reported to Discord as a screenshot
of the result screen plus a rendered win/loss card (see

to do per match now lives only behind Settings > Debug's on-demand "Read

rest of the Battle-phase block types (Walk/Wait/Setting), plug in once those
